                <p>Probably you will most frequently use these:</p>

                <p>However, it's also good to know about these:</p>

            <p>I'm going to go ahead and quote here from a great piece in <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20130104231015/https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/07/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake' target='_blank'>Smashing Mag</a>, way back from 2011:</p>
            <blockquote>In print, type as small as 8 points is an ideal compromise between readability and cost, because you have to pay for every millimeter you use. On the Web, you pay nothing for using more space — provided that readers find your copy compelling, of course. What you do pay for is readers finding your compelling copy so hard to read that they click away instead of converting.</blockquote>

                <p style='font-size: 12px;'>AS GREGOR SAMSA awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.</p>

            <p>Font size also isn't just a question of readability -- it can be used to draw the reader's eye to important content, or to organize the rhythm and flow of a design.</p>

          <div class='popexcont'>
            <p>Line height is another one of those things that can mean the difference between easily readable and totally illegible. A good rule of thumb is to keep your <code>line-height</code> property between <code>1.2em</code> and <code>1.4em</code>.</p>

            <p>Letter-spacing is often more of a consmetic consideration than a practical one, but it can still make some elements more readable or less readable. Let's take a look at some navigations.</p>
